# Deploy the app with Helm Charts

Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications — Helm Charts helps you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

During this lab, we are going to install a helm client and configure it. Then we are going to deploy the same app with Helm.

Charts are easy to create, version, share, and publish — so start using Helm and stop the copy-and-paste madness.

Helm is a client/server application :
* Helm client
* Tiller server.

## Initialize Helm & Tiller

1. Initialize Helm by navigating and running the below command in your cluster
    ```sh
    helm init
    ```

    Results:
    ```
    $ helm init
    $HELM_HOME has been configured at /Users/mace/.helm.

    Tiller (the Helm server-side component) has been installed into your Kubernetes Cluster.

    Please note: by default, Tiller is deployed with an insecure 'allow unauthenticated users' policy.
    For more information on securing your installation see: https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#securing-your-helm-installation
    Happy Helming!
    ```

1. Verify that the tiller-deploy pod has a Status of Running in your cluster.
    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l app=helm
    ```

    Results:
    ```
    NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    tiller-deploy-75f5797b-sxmrq   1/1       Running   0          4m
    ```

## Deploy the app with Helm

1. Go to the folder kubernetes/helm/chart
    ```sh
    cd .cloud/chart/mytodos
    ```

1. Edit the file **values.yaml** to change the repository values which includes: the region, the registry namespace, the image name, and the tag (=version).

    ```yaml
      # Default values for mytodos.
      # This is a YAML-formatted file.
      # Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

    replicaCount: 3

    image:
      repository: <region>.icr.io/<namespace>/todo-<lastname>
      tag: "1.0"
      pullPolicy: Always

     # secret:
     #   database: database-credentials

    nameOverride: ""
    fullnameOverride: ""

    service:
      type: ClusterIP
      port: 8080

    ingress:
      enabled: true
      annotations:
        # Force the use of https if the request is http
        ingress.bluemix.net/redirect-to-https: "True"
    path: /
    hosts:
        - todo.<cluster-name>.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud
    tls:
        - secretName: <cluster-name>
        hosts:
            - todo.<cluster-name>.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud

    resources:
      # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
      # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
      # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
      # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
    limits:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 384Mi
    requests:
        cpu: 250m
        memory: 128Mi

    nodeSelector: {}

    tolerations: []

    affinity: {}
    ```

1. Helm runs with "default" service account. Set the right permissions to be able to install package
    ```
    kubectl create clusterrolebinding add-on-cluster-admin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:default
    ```
    > Installing package will throw this error if you don't have the correction permission: `Error: UPGRADE FAILED: configmaps is forbidden`

1. Install a Helm chart
    ```sh
    helm upgrade mytodos . --install
    ```

    Results:
    ```
    NAME:   mytodos

    ```

1. Get the status of the helm deployment
    ```
    helm status mytodos
    ```

1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
    ```
    https://todo.<cluster-name>.eu-de.containers.appdomain.cloud/
    ```

    > To run with local values in debug mode: ```
    helm install . --name mytodos --values=local-values.yaml --dry-run --debug```

## Delete your deployment

1. To delete your deployment
    ```
    helm delete --purge mytodos
    ```

    > Generally, an helm chart is managing many pods, deployments, secrets, volumes and services. So deleting the chart is a quick way to clean up your work.
