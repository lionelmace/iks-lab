# Using Custom URLs for your app by adding Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)

In Cloud Internet Services, an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, lets you use your own domain name (for example, www.example.com) in your appâ€™ URL instead of using the domain name that IKS assigns to your cluster.

In this section, we will leverage two IBM Cloud Services:
    * [CIS - Cloud Internet Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/internet-services) which includes Domain Name Service (DNS), Global Load Balancer (GLB), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection, Web Application Firewall (WAF), etc.

    * [Certificate Manager](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/certificate-manager) to order and manage SSL/TLS certificates.

## Add a DNS record with CIS

To create a custom domain, you will need an instance of CIS and the hostname of your VPC Load Balancer created automatically during the cluster provisioning.

1. You will need an instance of [CIS - Cloud Internet Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/internet-services). You can create one for free.

1. Retrieve the cluster ID

    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster get -c <cluster-name> | grep ID
    ```

1. Retrieve the LB ID

    ```sh
    ibmcloud is lbs | grep <cluster-id>
    ```

1. Retrieve the VPC LB hostname

    ```sh
    ibmcloud is lb <vpc-lb-id> --output json | grep hostname
    ```

1. To create a new domain, go to Reliability > DNS.

1. Add a DNS record with the following information:

    * Type:  `CNAME`
    * Name:  `mytodo.example.com`
    * Alias: `Your VPC LB hostname`

## Order a TLS certificate for the new domain

1. Create a free instance of [Certificate Manager](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/certificate-manager)

1. Authorize Certificate Manager to access Cloud Internet Services
https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/certificate-manager?topic=certificate-manager-ordering-certificates#cis

1. In the instance of Certificate Manager, order a new Certificate, select Cloud Internet Services.

1. Select your CIS instance and click sub-domain. You should see the CNAME you created in CIS.

1. Get your certificate CRN

## Create a Kubernetes secret to store the TLS certificate

1. Get your cluster id

    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster get -c <cluster-name>
    ```

1. Create a new Kubernetes secret

    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks ingress secret create --name <secret-name> --cluster <cluster-id> --cert-crn <cert-crn>
    ```

    Example:

    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks ingress secret create --name mytodo-iks-cert --cluster c5di7erf0mv7dsr142dg --cert-crn crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloudcerts:eu-de:a/0b5a00334eaf9eb9339d2ab48f7326b4:d1698ea4-6209-444e-a21c-8d38c6b88c49:certificate:42b44eada278448bce72c6a74685ffd3
    ```

1. Verify that your secret was created

    ```sh
    kubectl get secrets -n ibm-cert-store
    ```

## Update the ingress with the new domain

1. Edit your yaml to replace the default domain by the new custom domain.

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: mytodo-ingress
      namespace: default
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "public-iks-k8s-nginx"
        # kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "private-iks-k8s-nginx"
        # Force the use of https if the request is http
        ingress.bluemix.net/redirect-to-https: "True"
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <your-custom-domain>
        secretName: <secret-name>
      rules:
      - host: <your-custom-domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: mytodo
                port:
                  number: 8080
    ```

1. Update the new ingress

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f mytodo.yaml
    ```

    Output should confirm the ingress was changed:
    ```
    deployment.apps/mytodo unchanged
    ingress.extensions/mytodo-ingress configured
    service/mytodo unchanged
    ```

## Open your app in a secure way

1. Open the new url that should have this format

    https://your-custom-domain.com
