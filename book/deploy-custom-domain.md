# Using Custom URLs for your app by adding Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)

In Cloud Internet Services, an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, lets you use your own domain name (for example, www.example.com) in your appâ€™ URL instead of using the domain name that IKS assigns to your cluster.

In this section, we will leverage two IBM Cloud Services:
* [CIS - Cloud Internet Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/internet-services) which includes Domain Name Service (DNS), Global Load Balancer (GLB), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection, Web Application Firewall (WAF), etc.

* [Certificate Manager](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/certificate-manager) to order and manage SSL/TLS certificates.

## Create a custom domain with CIS

To create a custom domain, you will need an instance of CIS and the hostname of your VPC Load Balancer created automatically during the cluster provisioning.

1. You will need an instance of [CIS - Cloud Internet Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/internet-services). You can create one for free.

1. Retrieve the cluster ID

    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster get -c iks | grep ID
    ```

1. Retrieve the LB ID

    ```
    ibmcloud is lbs | grep <cluster-id>
    ```

1. Retrieve the VPC LB hostname

    ```
    ibmcloud is lb <vpc-lb-id> --output json | grep hostname
    ```

1. To create a new domain, go to Reliability > DNS.

1. Add a DNS record with the following information:

    * Type:  `CNAME`
    * Name:  `mytodo.example.com`
    * Alias: `Your VPC LB hostname`


## Create a TLS certificate for the new domain

1. Create a free instance of [Certificate Manager](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/certificate-manager)

1. Authorize Certificate Manager to access Cloud Internet Services
https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/certificate-manager?topic=certificate-manager-ordering-certificates#cis

1. In the instance of Certificate Manager, order a new Certificate, select Cloud Internet Services.

1. Select your CIS instance and click sub-domain. You should see the CNAME you created in CIS.

1. Get your certificate CRN

## Create a new secret in your cluster to store the TLS certificate

1. Get your cluster id

    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster get -c <cluster-name>
    ```

1. Create a new Kubernetes secret

    ```
    ibmcloud ks ingress secret create --name <secret-name> --cluster <cluster-id> --cert-crn <cert-crn>
    ```

1. Verify that your secret was created

    ```
    kubectl get secrets -n ibm-cert-store
    ```

## Re-deploy your app with the new domain

1. Edit your yaml to replace the default domain by the new custom domain.

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: mytodo-ingress
      namespace: mytodo
      annotations:
        # Force the use of https if the request is http
        ingress.bluemix.net/redirect-to-https: "True"
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <your-custom-domain>
        secretName: <new-cert-secret>
      rules:
      - host: <your-custom-domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              serviceName: mytodo
              servicePort: 8080
    ```

1. Re-deploy

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f mytodo.yaml
    ```

    Output shoud confirm the ingress was changed:
    ```
    deployment.apps/mytodo unchanged
    ingress.extensions/mytodo-ingress configured
    service/mytodo unchanged
    ```

## Open your app in a secure way

1. Open the new url that should have this format

    https://<your-custom-domain>
