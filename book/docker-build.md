# Build the docker image with your application code

Before you can deploy the application on the cluster, you first need to build the Docker image.

1. **Build** a Docker image. Make sure to replace the value region and namespace
    ```sh
    docker build . -t <region>.icr.io/lab-registry/todo-<yourlastname>:1.0
    ```
    > Region is **de** for the Frankfurt datacenter.

    {% hint style='info' %}
    If you use the Cloud Shell, docker is not available yet. So we'll use the command:
    ibmcloud cr build . -t <region>.icr.io/lab-registry/todo-yourlastname:1.0
    {% endhint %}

1. Verify that the image was successfully added to your local docker registry
    ```sh
    docker images
    ```
    Output:
    ```
