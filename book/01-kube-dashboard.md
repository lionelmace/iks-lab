# Kubernetes Dashboard

Dashboard is a web-based Kubernetes user interface. You can use Dashboard to
* deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster
* troubleshoot your containerized application
* manage the cluster resources
* get an overview of applications running on your cluster
* create or modify individual Kubernetes resources (such as Deployments, Jobs, DaemonSets, etc)
* scale a Deployment
* initiate a rolling update
* restart a pod or deploy new applications using a deploy wizard.

Dashboard also provides information on the state of Kubernetes resources in your cluster and on any errors that may have occurred.
