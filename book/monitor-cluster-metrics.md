# Monitoring metrics with Sysdig

Sysdig Monitor is part of Sysdigâ€™s container intelligence platform. Sysdig uses a unified platform to deliver security, monitoring, and forensics in a container and microservices-friendly architecture.

Once the agent has started sending metrics to Sysdig for your environment, you can use the Sysdig Monitor UI to view and analyze that data.
