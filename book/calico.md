# Control traffic with Calico network policies

Every Kubernetes cluster is set up with a network plug-in called [Calico](https://www.projectcalico.org/). Default network policies are set up to secure the public network interface of every worker node in IKS.

If you have unique security requirements, you can use Calico and Kubernetes to create network policies for a cluster. With Kubernetes network policies, you can specify the network traffic that you want to allow or block to and from a pod within a cluster. 


## Install the Calico CLI

{% hint style='info' %} The Calico CLI is pre-installed in the **Cloud Shell**. If you use it, then you can skip this step and open the [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.ibm.com/shell) to continue the next steps.{% endhint %}

1. On Mac OS, install Calico with Homebrew
    ```
    brew install calico
    ```
    
1. Otherwise, [download the Calico CLI.](https://github.com/projectcalico/calicoctl/releases).


## Configure the Calico CLI

1.  Include the --admin and --network options with the `ibmcloud ks cluster config` command. **--admin** downloads the keys to access your infrastructure portfolio and run Calico commands on your worker nodes. **--network** downloads the Calico configuration file to run all Calico commands.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --admin --network
    ```

1. Create the /etc/calico directory.
    ```
     sudo mkdir /etc/calico
    ```

1. Move the Calico configuration file that you previously downloaded to the directory.
    ```
    mv /Users/<user>/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/<cluster_name>-admin/calicoctl.cfg /etc/calico
    ```

1. Verify that the Calico configuration is working correctly.
    ```
    calicoctl get nodes
    ```


## To view existing network policies in clusters

1. View all of the Calico and Kubernetes network policies that were created by default for the cluster.

    Network policies are scoped to specific namespaces:
    ```
    calicoctl get NetworkPolicy --all-namespaces -o wide
    ```

    Global network policies are not scoped to specific namespaces:
    ```
    calicoctl get GlobalNetworkPolicy -o wide
    ```

1. View details for a network policy.
    ```
    calicoctl get NetworkPolicy -o yaml <policy_name> --namespace <policy_namespace>
    ````

1. View the details of all global network policies for the cluster.
    ````
    calicoctl get GlobalNetworkPolicy -o yaml
    ```

## Block the incoming traffic to the Automatic Load Balancer

1. Edit the calico policy in folder **kubernetes/calico-deny-alb-traffic.yml** to replace the ALB IPs.
    ```yml
    --- 
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: deny-alb-traffic
    spec:
      applyOnForward: true
      preDNAT: true
      ingress:
      - action: Deny
        destination:
          nets:
          # (ALB) Automatic Load Balancer (= Ingress Subdomain)
          # dig <cluster-name>.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud
          - <Automatic_Load_Balancer_IP>/32
          - <Automatic-Load-Balancer_IP>/32
          - <Automatic_Load_Balancer_IP>/32
          ports:
          - 80
          - 443
        protocol: TCP
        source: {}
      selector: ibm.role == 'worker_public'
      order: 4000
      types:
      - Ingress
    ```

1. Apply this Global Network Policy to deny all ingress traffic.
    ```
    calicoctl apply -f calico-deny-alb-traffic.yml
    ```

1. You should not be access any apps available on your sub domains **containers.appdomain.cloud**.

## Whitelist the incoming traffic from your laptop IP.

1. Find the IP of your laptop.

1. Edit the calico policy in folder **kubernetes/calico-allow-traffic-from-my-ip.yml** to replace the ALB IPs and your laptop IP.
    ```yml
    ---
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: allow-traffic-from-my-ip
    spec:
      applyOnForward: true
      preDNAT: true
      ingress:
      - action: Allow
        destination:
          nets:
          # (ALB) Automatic Load Balancer (= Ingress Subdomain)
          # dig <cluster-name>.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud
          - <Automatic_Load_Balancer_IP>/32
          - <Automatic-Load-Balancer_IP>/32
          - <Automatic_Load_Balancer_IP>/32
          ports:
          - 80
          - 443
        protocol: TCP
        source:
          nets:
          -  <your-laptop-ip>/32
      selector: ibm.role == 'worker_public'
      order: 2000
      types:
      - Ingress
    ```

1. Apply this Global Network Policy to allow the traffic.
    ```
    calicoctl apply -f calico-allow-traffic-from-my-ip.yml
    ```

     

1. Both rules you applied are now listed in the Global network policies of your cluster.
    ```
    calicoctl get GlobalNetworkPolicy -o wide
    ```

1. You should now be able to access any apps available on your sub domains **containers.appdomain.cloud** from your laptop.
